# sqliteassignment

I learned some new skills in usingSQLiteStudio. I have just a little knowledge of databases. I would analyze tables from db's in college but not create a hands on to practice. I learned how to install it and how the connect the database from VS code to SQLiteStudio. I learned how use the DML commands: SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, and DELETE in my database Bookstore to add, delete, or update books from my Books table. The challenges I faced was understanding the instructions on how to set up the database because I haven't created a database before the terminology was difficult to understand when working through steps of the assignment. Another challenge I faced was understanding how to execute the SQL queries. I would make mistakes and get errors but once I asked questions and was taught how to use it. It made it more easier to understand what is happening in the database and how it is being read.
